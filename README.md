# README.md for Drag and Drop Sorting Activity

## Overview
This project provides an interactive drag and drop activity designed for educational software. It allows users to sort steps in a process by dragging and dropping descriptions into the correct order. This activity can be used to enhance learning experiences, particularly in understanding sequences and procedures.

## Features
- **Interactive Drag and Drop Interface**: Users can drag steps from a list and drop them into the corresponding boxes to order them correctly.
- **Dynamic Content Selection**: Includes a dropdown menu to select different sets of steps for sorting, such as 'Conduct Negotiations' or 'Make Peanut Butter Sandwich'.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides immediate visual feedback by changing the color of the step box to green when the step is correctly placed.
- **Undo Functionality**: An undo button allows users to revert their last action.
- **Completion Summary**: Displays a summary of successfully completed steps along with additional notes.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Structures the webpage and hosts the drag and drop interface.
- `styles.css`: Provides styling for the webpage and the drag and drop elements.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic for the drag and drop functionality and dynamic interaction.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Task**: Choose a task from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.
2. **Drag and Drop Steps**: Drag descriptions from the left-hand side and drop them into the correct numbered box on the right-hand side.
3. **Correct Placement**: If a step is correctly placed, its box will turn green, and a note will be displayed at the bottom.
4. **Undo Steps**: Use the 'Undo Last Step' button to revert the last action if needed.
5. **View Summary**: Check the completed steps and notes at the bottom of the page.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- No additional libraries or frameworks are required.

## Customization
The code can be easily customized to include different sets of steps or to modify the styling and behavior. This can be done by editing the arrays in the `script.js` file and adjusting the CSS in `styles.css`.

## Potential Enhancements
- Adding more interactive elements, such as animations.
- Implementing responsive design for better mobile device compatibility.
- Adding more sets of steps for different activities.
- Incorporating error handling and user input validation for robustness.
